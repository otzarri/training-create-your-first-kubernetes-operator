# Setup environment

Before beginning this tutorial it is necessary that you have installed the tools that will be used.

In this challenge you will:

- Install the required tools
- Create a local kubernetes cluster


## üêøÔ∏è Install the Go language

Go is a general-purpose programming language, so you can write any operator logic you want. Kubernetes itself is written in Go, so this language interacts smoothly with Kubernetes API.

You can chose between installing Go using the package manager of your operating system or using [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm), which enables your system to keep different versions of Go installed and switch between them on-demand.

Install `gvm` with the command below. If you are using bash just change `zsh` with `bash`.

```shell
zsh < <(curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moovweb/gvm/master/binscripts/gvm-installer)
source ~/.gvm/scripts/gvm
```

Install go version 1.19 and set it as default version:

```shell
gvm install go1.19
gvm use go1.19 --default
```


## üñµ Install kubectl

Kubernetes provides a command line tool for communicating with a Kubernetes cluster's control plane, using the Kubernetes API. This tool is named `kubectl`. For configuration, `kubectl` looks for a file named config in the $HOME/.kube directory. You can specify other kubeconfig files by setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable or by setting the `--kubeconfig` flag.

To install `kubectl`:

```shell
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```


## üèóÔ∏è Install kubebuilder

Kubebuilder is an SDK for rapidly building and publishing Kubernetes APIs in Go. It builds on top of the canonical techniques used to build the core Kubernetes APIs to provide simple abstractions that reduce boilerplate and toil. Similar to web development frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and SpringBoot, Kubebuilder increases velocity and reduces the complexity managed by developers.

To install `kubebuilder`:

```shell
curl -L -o kubebuilder https://go.kubebuilder.io/dl/latest/$(go env GOOS)/$(go env GOARCH)
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubebuilder
```

## üêã Install Docker

Docker is a tool that is used to automate the deployment of applications in lightweight containers so that applications can work efficiently in different environments. `Kind` will create here the nodes for the Kubernetes clusters.

Follow the [Docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for your OS and install it.


## üçæ Install kind

[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes", bootstraping each ‚Äúnode‚Äù with [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/). It was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI. It's lightweight and easy to integrate in the development workflows.

Run the command below to install `kind`.

```shell
go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.17.0
```

## ‚éà Create a single-node local Kubernetes cluster

You need a running Kubernetes cluster to develop the operator. Let's deploy a single-node cluster locally for a faster development.

Use this command to create the cluster:

```shell
kind create cluster
```

Configure `kubectl` to use this cluster:

```shell
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind
```

Check you can operate the cluster with `kubectl`:

```
kubectl get all -A
```

Additionally, you can see the Docker container running the kubernetes node. The container name is `kind-control-plane`.

```
docker ps 
```


## ‚öôÔ∏è System configuration

This is the configuration of the system used to build this tutorial:

| Setting      | Value                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Architecture | x86_64                 |
| OS family    | GNU/Linux              |
| OS distro    | Manjaro 22.0.3 Sikaris |
| K8s distro   | kind 0.17.0            |
| Go version   | 1.19                   |
| kubebuilder  | 3.9.0                  |
| kubectl      | 1.25.3                 |
